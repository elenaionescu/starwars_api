# Starwars Api

## User Story:
As a user, I can search for people from the Star Wars movies using the open source Star Wars API
 
## Description:
Using the open source Star Wars API (https://swapi.co) please build a small ES6+ based React application which uses an autocomplete search to search for 'People' from the Star Wars movies.
 
Notes:
 
	•	Use Create React App as a base for your application 
	•	There is no right or wrong approach to the task - or limit to specifically what you implement - we just want to get an idea of your approach and coding style
	•	Please provide access to your completed app at least 24 hours before your interview as follows:
	•	Commit to a Github account and give access to lego-gbsimyou (preferred)
	•	Send a ZIP file by email to your LEGO recruitment contact
